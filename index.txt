<p> I’m Yacine Fares, a recent graduate of Harvard College, where I studied applied math and economics. I currently work at Uber as a data scientist in the marketplace optimization org. Previously, I was a quantitative investment analyst at Convexity Capital Management, in Boston. I will be using to site to jot down some thoughts on data science, machine learning, econometrics, and quant finance, hoping to share as I learn. </p>
